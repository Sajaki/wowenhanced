Here is a list of things that need to be added/fixed:

1. Start adding compatability for all patches in this repo, so users always have the most uptodate web, no matter what patch 
they are using.
2. Remove the old forums and create a new "news" module.
3. Make a custom non-blizzlike template, so users can use mangosweb, with a normal custom template.
4. Continue to make MangosWeb easier to install and run, As well as improved compatibility with browsers other then Firefox.


Thats all i can think of for now. Feel free to submit and code or patches Here (if your not a developer):
